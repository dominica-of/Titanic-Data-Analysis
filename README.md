# Titanic-Data-Analysis
This project is a comprehensive data analysis of the Titanic dataset. I first clean the data, create new features, and perform exploratory data analysis using various types of plots.

This GitHub repository contains a notebokk that conducts a comprehensive data analysis on the Titanic dataset. The repository is structured in a simple and easy-to-follow manner to allow users to replicate the analysis on their local machine. 

This project, starts by loading the Titanic dataset, followed by performing data cleaning where missing values are handled appropriately. Additionally, the script also generates a new feature called 'family_size' based on the existing features in the dataset. 

Post data cleaning and transformation, several data visualization techniques are employed to explore and understand the data better. These include creating a histogram to visualize the age distribution of passengers, a box plot to compare the fares between survivors and non-survivors, a heatmap to observe correlations among different variables, and a pairplot to explore pairwise relationships with respect to survival status.

This repository serves as a practical resource for those interested in hands-on data analysis and visualization using Python.
